# Housing_prices_predictions
This project is an example implementation of housing price prediction using machine learning techniques in Python. It covers various aspects of the machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and fine-tuning.

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: Overview of the project and instructions.
- **housing.csv**: Housing dataset used for the project.
- **basic_ml.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Key Concepts Covered

- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables.
- Model building: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor.
- Model evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), cross-validation.
- Fine-tuning the model: Grid Search, Randomized Search.
